WordClusters folder:
contains CSV results for clustering after truncated SVD 

PersonalityClusters folder:
contains CSV results from clustering after personality analysis

models folder:
some of the analysis is slow, so we saved the objects and data needed to cluster by word.
These include the CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, The tfidfTransformed data,
and the Truncated SVD transformed data, so that it does not need to be rerun each 
time.

.ods files (libre office calc files, are excell-like files of cluster analysis)
